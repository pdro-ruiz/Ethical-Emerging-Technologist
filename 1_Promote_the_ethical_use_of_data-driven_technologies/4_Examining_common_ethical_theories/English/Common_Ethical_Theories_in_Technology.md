## Moral Philosophical Theories

### Moral Philosophy

- **Objective:** To explore concepts of right and wrong behavior.
- **Applicability:** Useful for everyone, not just academics; influences everyday life through respect, justice, and avoiding harm to others.

#### Areas of Study in Ethics

- **Metaethics:** Theoretical; studies the nature of ethics.
- **Normative Ethics:** Rules on how to act ethically (main focus).
- **Applied Ethics:** Implementation of ethics in real situations (main focus).

#### Normative Ethics

- **Purpose:** Guide for decision-making, establishing duties and considering consequences on others.
- **Importance:** Defines right and wrong, avoiding hypocrisy and guiding actions.
- **Consequences of Ignoring It:** Can lead to contradictory behaviors and unfortunate situations.

#### Applied Ethics

- **Focus:** Consider practical actions and moral consequences in real-world situations.
- **Key Example:** Bioethics, applying ethical principles in the medical and biological field.
- **Objective:** To make informed and moral decisions considering the needs and interests of others.

#### Disciplines of Applied Ethics

- Multiple disciplines will be addressed later, emphasizing how normative and applied ethics are implemented 
  in various areas to guide ethical decisions in the real world.

#### Notes

- Ethics is fundamental in daily decision-making and social interaction.
- Normative ethics establishes a framework of what is morally right or wrong.
- Applied ethics brings these principles into practical situations, resolving moral dilemmas in specific contexts.
- Understanding and applying ethical principles promotes consistency and responsibility in our actions and decisions.



### Moral Relativism

#### Moral Relativism

- **Definition:** Moral norms vary among cultures and individuals; there are no moral absolutes.
- **Metaethics:** There are no objective moral truths.
- **Normative Ethics:** It's wrong to judge morals that differ from one's own.

#### Moral Absolutism

- **Examples:** Stealing, killing, lying, and deceiving are always wrong, regardless of circumstances.

#### Pluralism

- **Definition:** Recognizes multiple valid moral truths that may conflict.
- **Example:** The U.S. Supreme Court supports both liberal and conservative decisions.

#### Importance in Technology

- **Diverse Culture:** Ethics based on a wide cultural base must be acknowledged in the design of technological systems.
- **Organizational Stance:** Organizations must clearly define and communicate their ethics, 
  and be prepared to defend it to stakeholders.

#### Notes

- Moral relativism reflects cultural diversity and temporal evolution of moral norms, highlighting the difficulty of applying universal moral judgment.
- Moral absolutism provides a solid foundation for ethical judgment but may lack flexibility and cultural sensitivity.
- Pluralism offers a middle path, accepting multiple moral perspectives as valid and potentially conflicting, but still legitimate.
- In technological application, recognizing moral and cultural diversity is crucial for ethical development, as well as for the global adoption and acceptance of emerging technologies.



### Deontology

#### Definition and Principles

- **Deontology:** An ethical theory based on rules to differentiate between right and wrong, emphasizing the importance of following universal moral laws.
- **Origin:** Associated with Immanuel Kant, an 18th-century philosopher.
- **Morality:** Determined by reason and rationality, not by consequences.
- **Ethical Actions:** Follow universal moral laws, such as not lying, not stealing, and not deceiving.
- **

Intrinsic Good:** The only truly good thing is good will; pleasure is not intrinsic.

#### Strengths

- **Moral Clarity:** Offers clear and easy-to-follow guidance based on moral intuitions.
- **Individual Rights:** Protects individual rights and ensures justice by not basing on consequences.
- **Duties Toward People:** Emphasizes duties towards others, ensuring their rights are not violated.

#### Comparison with Consequentialism

- **Rule vs. Consequences Focus:** Unlike consequentialism, which values actions by their outcomes, 
  deontology focuses on adherence to moral rules.
- **Rights and Justice:** Deontology prevents violation of individual rights that could be justified in consequentialism to achieve a "greater good".

#### Examples

- **Pleasure:** Considered not intrinsic since it can be derived from others' suffering.
- **Self-Defense:** Even killing in self-defense is considered wrong, reiterating that actions are judged by motives, not consequences.

#### Notes

- Deontology provides an ethical framework that values intention and adherence to universal norms over the outcomes of actions.
- This approach emphasizes the importance of acting with good will and respecting moral duties, regardless of the consequences that may arise.
- It ensures the protection of individual rights and the promotion of justice, offering a clear moral distinction that can be especially useful in complex ethical dilemmas.



### Kant's Categorical Imperative

#### Definition and Basic Principles

- **Categorical Imperative:** A fundamental principle in Kant's deontological philosophy that establishes moral duties based on reason.
- **Imperative Nature:** Must be obeyed unconditionally.
- **Categorical Nature:** Universally applicable to all people in all situations, without exceptions.

#### First Formulation: Universality

- **Principle:** Act only in such a way that the maxim of your action can be adopted as a universal law.
- **Example:** If it's wrong for one to kill, it's wrong for all.
- **Universalizability:** Moral principles must apply equally to oneself and others.

#### Second Formulation: End in Itself

- **Principle:** Act in such a way that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in that of another, always as an end and never merely as a means.
- **Importance:** Recognizes the intrinsic moral value of people, forbidding their use merely to achieve one's own end.

#### Third Formulation: Universal Lawgiving Will

- **Principle:** Act as if the maxim of your action were to become by your will a universal law of nature.
- **Meaning:** Moral laws must be endorsed by all rational beings and not violate the freedoms of others.

#### Strengths

- Protects individual rights and ensures justice, not based on consequences.
- Promotes respect for the dignity and intrinsic moral value of people.

#### Criticisms and Challenges

- **Main Criticism:** Ethical dilemmas, such as lying to a murderer, where following the universal law seems to go against the good.
- **Kant's Response:** Even in such cases, lying is morally unacceptable according to the categorical imperative.




### Universalizability

#### Universalizability: Definition and Parallels

- **Key Concept:** First formulation of Kant's categorical imperative; moral applicable universally to all, at all times.
- **Similarity to the Golden Rule:** Treat others as you wish to be treated, emphasizing considering acts from the perspective of others.

- **Focus:** The end justifies the means.

##### Examples of Application

#### Utilitarianism: Principles and Advocates

- **Definition:** The main consequentialist theory focused on maximizing happiness for the greatest number of people.
- **Founders:** Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill.
- **Utility:** Overall well-being considered as the most important consequence.

##### Types of Utilitarianism
