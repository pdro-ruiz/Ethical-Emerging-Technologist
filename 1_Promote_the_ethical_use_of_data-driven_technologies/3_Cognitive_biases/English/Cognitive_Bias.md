# Cognitive Bias


## Bias in AI and Its Impact

### The Importance of Ethics in AI

- Artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms significantly influence our lives, both personally and professionally.
  It is crucial that these technologies operate fairly and are meticulously audited to minimize any inherent bias.

### Main Causes of Bias

1. **Incomplete Data:** Data sets may not fully reflect reality, lacking the necessary diversity or breadth.
2. **Prejudiced Labeling:** Preexisting human decisions or perceptions, used to label information, can introduce biases that are then perpetuated by automated systems.
3. **Complex Auditing:** Identifying and correcting bias in data-based technologies requires a conscious and meticulous effort, and should never be compromised for efficiency.



## Biases in Society

### Bias

#### Definition of Bias

- **General:** Prejudice in favor or against one thing, person, or group compared to another, which can affect understanding and outcomes, preventing neutrality or objectivity.

#### Manifestation of Bias

- **Positive:** For example, a preference for a plant-based diet.
- **Negative:** More frequent, associated with injustices, such as gender or religion-based biases.

#### Origin of Bias

- **Learning:** Biases are mostly learned through personal experiences, family influence, and social circles,
   perpetuating learned prejudices over time.
- **Patterns and Differences:** The brain seeks patterns and notices differences, but negative associations are learned, not innate.

#### Analytical Focus

- **Bias in Society:** How biases manifest and affect social groups on a large scale.
- **Bias in Thinking:** The influence of bias on individual perception and decision-making processes.
- **Bias in Data:** The impact of bias on data collection, interpretation, and use, especially relevant in the context 
  of artificial intelligence and machine learning.

#### Importance
- This three-dimensional approach allows for a comprehensive analysis of bias, highlighting its complexity and the various areas of impact. 
  By understanding these perspectives, we can begin to develop strategies for identifying, understanding, and mitigating biases in our lives and technologies.

### Cognitive Bias

#### Introduction to Cognitive Biases:
- **Origin:** Introduced by Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman in 1972.
- **Definition:** Systematic errors in thinking that affect decisions and judgments during the information processing.
- **Causes:** The brain's attempt to handle its limitations by efficiently processing information through heuristics or mental shortcuts.

#### Types of Cognitive Biases:

1. **Anchoring Bias:**
   - Relying too heavily on the first piece of information received.
   - Example: Salary negotiations based on the first offer.
2. **Fundamental Attribution Error:**
   - Attributing one's own behavior to situations and others' to personality traits.
   - Example: "I was late because of traffic" vs. "He is lazy".
3. **Group Attribution Error:**
   - Believing that attributes of an individual reflect the characteristics of the group.
   - Example: Generalizations based on actions of a team.
4. **False Consensus Effect:**
   - Overestimating how normal our ideas are and how much others agree.
   - Example: Strong beliefs about environmental issues.
5. **Optimism Bias:**
   - Believing we are less exposed to negative experiences and more prone to positive ones than others.
   - Example: Underestimating personal risks.

#### Impact and Management:
- **Impact:**
  - Can be useful (such as optimism bias) but can also lead to manipulation and support the creation of stereotypes.
- **

Management:**
  - Awareness and critical review of our own decisions.
  - Seeking a diversity of sources and ideas.
  - Dialogue with people from various perspectives.
  - Reflection on past judgments.

### Modeling Bias

#### Definition

- **Modeling Bias:** Occurs when the initial assumptions of researchers artificially limit the model, leading to erroneous data collection, biased questions, and selection of inappropriate algorithms.

#### Types of Prediction Error in Models

- **Bias:** Indicates how well a model fits a training set. A low-bias model fits the training set closely.
- **Variance:** Shows how much a model changes with different parts of the dataset during training. A high-variance model is very flexible and can produce different results with each dataset.

#### Bias-Variance Tradeoff

- Reducing bias increases variance and vice versa.
- Finding a balance is essential to avoid underfitting or overfitting.

#### Consequences

- **Underfitting:** Model not robust enough. High bias and low variance. Consistent but inaccurate on average.
- **Overfitting:** Excessively complex model that identifies unreal trends. Low bias and high variance. Accurate on average but inconsistent.

#### Strategies to Minimize Modeling Bias

- Adjust model complexity to minimize bias without introducing significant variance errors.
- Increase dataset size to allow more complex models minimizing the likelihood of variance errors.

#### Key Notes

- **Importance of Balance:** Finding the right point between model complexity and result consistency.
- **Expansion of Dataset:** Using a broader dataset to reduce the risk of overfitting and allow more accurate modeling.
- **Awareness of Assumptions:** Being aware of initial assumptions to avoid artificial limitations in modeling.
