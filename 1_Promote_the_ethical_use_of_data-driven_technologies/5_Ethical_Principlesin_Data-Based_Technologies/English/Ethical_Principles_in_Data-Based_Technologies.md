# Ethical Principles in Data-Based Technologies

## Acting on Ethical Principles

#### Introduction
The fifth week of the course on the ethical use of data-based technologies focuses on the importance and application of ethical principles in the technological realm. Renee Cummings, an expert in the subject, highlights the relevance of these principles as the code of conduct and evaluation for technologists.

#### Importance of Ethical Principles
- **Code of Conduct**: Ethical principles guide the behavior of technologists, ensuring that their actions and developments do not cause harm.
- **Digital Footprint and Technological Legacy**: Acting according to ethical principles defines a technologist's long-term legacy and reputation in the industry.
- **Responsibility and Trust**: Adopting an ethics-based approach fosters transparency and generates trust, essential for responsible technological implementation.

#### Examples of the Lack of Principles
Renee cites the case of a hiring system of a large tech company that, due to a lack of gender neutrality in the data, resulted in discrimination against women. This underscores the reputational risks and the importance of inclusive and ethical design.

#### Strategies for Applying Ethical Principles
- **Duty of Care and Due Process**: Technologists must identify and mitigate potential risks, ensuring ethical design and technological deployment.
- **Recognition of Imperfections**: Accepting that, despite the best ethical efforts, no technologies are perfect, but it is crucial to strive to do the right thing.
- **Incorporation into Corporate Culture**: Integrating ethical principles into corporate culture to guide critical decisions, such as the discontinuation of problematic technologies.





## Ethical Principles

### Autonomy

#### Concept of Autonomy
- **Definition**: The capacity to make decisions without coercion, based on self-governance.
- **Importance According to Kant**: Essential for morality; autonomous beings are subject to moral codes.
- **Impact of External Influences**: Although autonomy implies making one's own decisions, it can be affected by the environment and others' actions.

#### Autonomy in Emerging Technologies
- **Risks and Challenges**: AI and other technologies can significantly alter human autonomy, pressuring people to live according to system guidelines.
- **Specific Vulnerabilities**: Groups such as the elderly and children may be particularly affected due to their dependence on technology.

#### Addressing Autonomy in AI Design
- **Responsible Design**: It is crucial to design AI systems that respect human autonomy, being proactive in identifying and mitigating ethical risks.
- **Meta Autonomy**: Humans must retain the power to decide which decisions to delegate to technology, weighing efficiency against loss of control.
- **Risk Management**: Implement processes that identify, evaluate, and mitigate risks to autonomy during the development of AI systems.

#### Autonomy of Autonomous Systems
- **Robotics and Autonomy**: Exploring autonomy in robots can shed light on potential risks to human autonomy.

  - Crime prevention and law enforcement through AI, such as facial recognition and fraud detection.
  - There can be biases in implementation, disproportionately affecting certain groups.

- **Challenges**:
  - Possible violations of individual human rights like privacy and freedom of movement.
  - Potential increase in wealth and opportunity disparities.

#### Promoting Justice through AI
- **Fairness in Design**: The consideration of justice should be integrated from the design phase to minimize bias and promote just and equitable decisions.
- **Bias Minimization**: A system with reduced bias can lead to more accurate and fair conclusions.

#### Conclusion
- **Impact on Society**: AI and emerging technologies play a significant role in shaping justice in contemporary society.
- **Need for Equity**: It is crucial to design systems that ensure fairness and justice for all, recognizing and addressing the ethical and moral challenges that arise in their development and application.

- **Consciousness**: Recognition of one's own existence and that of other individuals.
- **Rights**: Persons are subjects of rights, whether by legal status or human.

#### Relevance and Application
- **Determines Treatment and Rights**: Personhood status dictates how an individual is treated and what rights and protections they are afforded.
- **Ethics Applied to AI**: Discussion on granting personhood status to AI, especially in the context of artificial general intelligence (AGI).

#### Persons and Robots
- **Electronic Persons**: Proposal for self-learning robots to receive electronic personhood, allowing for their insurance and liability for damages.
- **Legal Challenges**: Concerns about AI's "black box" and the manufacturers' responsibility for the robots' actions.

#### Sophia: A Special Case
- **Citizenship in Saudi Arabia**: The first robot to receive citizenship of a country, raising ethical debates about the rights granted in comparison to Saudi women and migrant workers.

#### Future Considerations
- **Rights and Responsibilities of AI**: Considering AI as a person would imply rights and subjection to moral and civil laws.
- **Ethical Impact**: Previously discussed ethical principles would need to be applied to machines, acknowledging their potential personhood status.





### Case Study: Officer Chip - Ethics in Chatbots

Officer Chip represents an innovative use of artificial intelligence in the public sector, specifically in the realm of police recruitment. This chatbot, designed to interact with potential police candidates, illustrates how ethical principles are applied in the development and use of emerging technologies.

#### Beneficence
- **Advantages**: Officer Chip enhances the recruitment process by providing a safe and accessible space for candidates to explore opportunities without the pressure of speaking directly to a human recruiter. This shows the principle of beneficence by actively seeking the good of the users and the organization.
- **Stress Reduction**: Frees human staff from repetitive tasks, allowing them to concentrate on more complex aspects of their work, which is beneficial for the overall well-being of the department.

#### Ethical Challenges
- **Autonomy and Continuous Surveillance**: As chatbots like Officer Chip become more autonomous through machine learning, there is a need for constant monitoring to ensure that learned data do not include inadvertent biases.
- **Bias and Accuracy**: Developers must be vigilant to prevent and correct biases that may arise, ensuring that the interactions and responses of the chatbot are not only accurate but also culturally sensitive and fair.
- **Data Privacy**: The ethical handling of personal information collected during interactions is crucial. Clear and transparent user agreements help protect individuals' privacy, aligning with the ethical principles of non-maleficence and justice.

#### Implications for the Future
- **Responsible Development**: This case underscores the importance of developing and deploying AI with continuous ethical consideration, which includes periodic reviews of the data and system behavior.
- **Protection of Personal Autonomy**: Ensuring that users understand how they interact with AI and what data are collected from them is essential for preserving personal autonomy.
- **Fighting Bias**: Implementing mechanisms to identify and correct biases in training data and chatbot responses is a critical step in ensuring fairness and justice in its operation.
