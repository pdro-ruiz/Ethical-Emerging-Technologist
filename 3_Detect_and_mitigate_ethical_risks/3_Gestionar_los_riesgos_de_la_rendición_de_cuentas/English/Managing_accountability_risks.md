# Managing Accountability Risks

## Overview

### Importance of Managing Accountability Risks

#### **Clarity in Decision-Making**
- **Definition**: Precisely understanding who is responsible for what actions within an organization.
- **Benefit**: Facilitates the investigation of incidents and understanding of their causes.

#### **Prevention of Unjust Blaming**
- **Avoids Scapegoating**: Prevents individuals from being unjustly pinpointed as solely responsible for complex issues.
- **Root Cause**: Aids in identifying and resolving the true source of problems beyond superficial blame assignment.

#### **Real-World Example: Challenger Space Shuttle Disaster**
- **Context**: Safety concerns raised by engineers before the launch.
- **Issue**: Organizational culture prevented precautionary voices from being adequately considered, leading to a tragedy.
- **Lesson**: Lack of accountability and clear communication about responsibilities contributed to the disaster.

## Sources of Risks

### Use of Third-Party Components

#### **Loss of Control**
- **Affected Areas**: Development, testing, maintenance.
- **Consequences**: Difficulties in ensuring components comply with own risk management standards and processes.

#### **Examples of Third-Party Components**
- **Commercial Products**: Pre-trained AI models, data sets, analytical tools.
- **Open-Source Software**: Libraries like scikit-learn, TensorFlow, among others.

#### **Challenges for Accountability**
- **Different Culture and Presumptions**: Models or data may come from contexts with different cultural or technical norms.
- **Closed-Source Nature**: Limitations in evaluating source code and verifying adherence to ethical or security standards.
- **Diffusion of Responsibility in Open-Source Projects**: Contributions from dispersed volunteers complicate accountability assignment.

#### **Management Strategies**
1. **Due Diligence**: Conduct thorough evaluations of third-party components before integration.
2. **Transparency and Documentation**: Maintain detailed records of the components used and their sources.
3. **Collaboration with Providers**: Work closely with third parties to understand the development and maintenance processes of components.
4. **Engagement in the Open-Source Community**: Contribute to the development and review of components to enhance their security and reliability.
5. **Risk Mitigation Strategies**: Develop action plans for cases where third-party components fail or present vulnerabilities.

### Automation Bias

#### **Definition and Causes**
- **Definition**: The tendency to rely on automated decisions over human ones, even when there is evidence of failures.
- **Psychological Causes**:
  - **Perceived Consistency**: Machines are seen as consistent and reliable.
  - **Association with Intelligence**: Automation equated with superior decision-making capability.
  - **Attraction to Innovation**: Automation represents progress and innovation, elevating its status regardless of actual utility.

#### **Manifestations of Bias**
- **Complacency**: Reduced vigilance and verification of automated decisions.
- **Blind Trust**: Acceptance of decisions from automated systems against common sense.
- **Reliability Paradox**: The higher the perceived reliability, the greater the complacency, potentially ignoring critical failures.

#### **Liability Risks**
- **Delegation of Control**: Overreliance on automated systems dilutes clarity about responsibility in decision-making.
- **Difficulty in Clear Attribution**: Hard to determine specific responsibilities in the event of failures, especially in complex AI systems.

#### **Real-World Examples**
- **Spell Checkers**: Erroneous auto-corrections accepted by users.
- **Automation in Aviation**: Incidents due to excessive reliance on autopilots.
- **Autonomous Vehicles**: Drivers relinquishing active control, fully trusting the technology.

#### **Mitigation of Automation Bias**
- **Awareness and Education**: Promote understanding of the limitations of automated systems.
- **Active Human Involvement**: Maintain human oversight as a critical check against excessive dependency on automation.
- **Verification Processes**: Implement procedures for regular review and validation of automated decisions.

### Extrajudicial Sentencing

#### **Definition and Examples**
- **Extrajudicial Sentencing**: Decisions with significant effects on individuals, made without the sanction of judicial authorities.
- **Example**: Nightclubs and restaurants sharing photos of persons deemed undesirable, banning them from various establishments without a formal legal process.

#### **Implications**
- **Limitations on Personal Freedom**: Restrictions based on non-judicial decisions can have profound and lasting effects on individuals.
- **Parallel Private Law System**: Creation of a punishment and exclusion regime operating outside the official legal system.
- **Lack of Recourse**: Difficulty or impossibility to appeal or correct decisions, even in cases of mistaken identity or injustice.

#### **Associated Risks**
- **Transparency**: Lack of clarity in the criteria and processes used for making decisions.
- **Bias and Discrimination**: Risk of decisions based on personal or societal prejudices.
- **Loss of Privacy**: Dissemination of personal information without explicit consent.
- **Ambiguous Liability**: Difficulty in determining who is responsible for decisions and their consequences.

#### **Considerations for Ethical Techn

ologists**

### Lack of Guiding Principles

#### **Importance of Guiding Principles**
- **Ethical Foundation**: Provide a framework for developing and using data-based technologies ethically.
- **Measure of Success**: Without clear global ethical objectives, it is impossible to measure the success of an organization's ethical integrity.
- **Accountability**: Determining responsibilities in ethical failures becomes complex without defined principles.

#### **Effects of Absence of Principles**
- **Confusion and Lack of Clarity**: Without clear principles, it is difficult to understand what constitutes an ethical failure.
- **Complacency and Corruption**: Lack of governance can lead to corruption and only reactive adherence to ethical principles.
- **Diffuse Responsibility**: Absence of clear direction complicates the assignment of responsibilities for maintaining principles.

#### **Examples of Ethical Failures**
- **Financial Scandals**: Enron, Parmalat, Worldcom, Sacham, and Toshiba involved in fraudulent accounting.
- **Fraud in the Automotive Industry**: Volkswagen falsified emissions tests, resulting in fines and costs exceeding $33 billion.
- **Embezzlement in Non-Profit Organizations**: The head of United Way America was convicted for embezzling charitable funds.

#### **Lessons and Strategies**

- **Disclosure Requirements**: Obligation to disclose information about the system, including strategies to address ethical issues.
- **Collection of Comments**: Inclusion of public feedback as an integral part of the evaluation process.
- **Due Process Challenges**: Establishment of mechanisms for the public to challenge compliance with the AIA.
- **AIA Renewal**: Periodic review and update of the AIA to ensure its relevance and effectiveness.

#### **Implementation of an AIA**
- Generally characterized by a questionnaire that guides organizations through a series of questions designed to identify potential ethical and accountability implications of their AI systems.
- The questions range from the transparency of the algorithm and model to the level of impact on the health, well-being, and rights of individuals.

#### **Example of AIA: Canadian Government**
- The Canadian government has implemented

 an AIA questionnaire to assess the impact of AI systems within government agencies, focused on maintaining principles of accountability and transparency.
- Provides impact and mitigation scores based on responses, helping organizations understand and mitigate the risks associated with their AI projects.
