- Risk management is an **iterative and continuous process**, fundamental to the emphasis on data and the promotion of ethics in organizations.

#### Elements of the Process
1. **Identification:** Recognize potential risks.
2. **Analysis:** Evaluate the nature and impact of identified risks.
3. **Mitigation:** Implement strategies to reduce or eliminate risks.

#### Characteristics of Good Risk Management
- **Creates Value:** By preventing, minimizing, or properly managing adverse events.
- **Organizational Integration:** A key part of the decision-making process.
- **Flexibility:** Capable of adapting to various business needs.
- **Continuous Improvement:** Constant evaluation and updating to maintain effectiveness and relevance.

#### Characteristics of Poor Risk Management
- **Lack of Value:** Excessive consumption of resources without providing adequate protection.
- **Isolation:** Lack of participation and integration with other areas of the organization.
- **Static:** Absence of adaptation to new information or changing contexts.

#### Importance of Risk Management
- Prevents unpreparedness for ethical problems.
- Essential to safeguard the integrity and ethics in the use of data-based technologies.

### Risk Identification

#### Introduction to the Process
- **Objective:** Know the risks before analyzing or mitigating them.
- **Method:** Brainstorming session with all stakeholders.

#### Contributions of Stakeholders
- **Diversity of Perspectives:** Varied contributions based on experience and function

.
 - **Examples:**
 - IT: Cybersecurity vulnerabilities.
 - Marketing: Accessibility for people with special needs.

#### Key Resources and Documents
- **Requirements List:** Risk identification through project obligations.
- **Additional Resources:** Mission objectives, work statements, schedules, cost estimates, disaster recovery and business continuity plans.

#### Strategies for Risk Identification
1. **Determination of Critical Factors:** Identify what the project needs to achieve.
2. **Evaluation of Critical Factors:** Consider potential failures and their impacts.
3. **Risk Databases:** Consult common risks to apply to specific projects.

#### Documentation and Continuity
- **Documenting Efforts:** Recording all identified risks.
- **Linking to the Project:** Associating risks with specific parts of the project.
- **Ongoing Process:** Identification should be recurring, adapting to changes in requirements or project direction.

#### Periodic Review
- Essential to review the risk landscape throughout the project lifecycle, especially in the face of changes.

### Risk Analysis

#### Main Objective
- **Understand the Root Cause:** Identify the main source that originates the risk.

#### Illustrative Example
- **Case:** An app that learns users' exercise patterns.
 - **Root Cause:** Lack of confidential data storage.
 - **Symptom:** Malicious users access health data without consent.

#### Importance of Differentiating Root Cause and Symptoms
- **Focus on the Root Cause:** Essential to address and mitigate the risk appropriately.
- **Identification of Symptoms:** Easier but does not solve the root problem.

#### Risk Analysis Methods
1. **Qualitative Risk Analysis:**
 - Assessment based on the probability and impact of the risk.
 - Uses terms like high, medium, and low to describe the risk.
 - Requires subjective judgment.

2. **Quantitative Risk Analysis:**
 - Uses statistical models and historical data.
 - Appropriate for risks that can be quantified.
 - Can be complex and not always applicable.

3. **Semi-quantitative Risk Analysis:**
 - Combines qualitative and quantitative approaches.
 - Uses descriptive terms supported by statistical models for a more objective assessment.

#### Consequences of Inadequate Analysis
- Risk of disaster or catastrophic loss to the organization if not properly assessed.

### Risk Mitigation

#### Key Concept
- **Risk Mitigation:** Minimizing the probability or impact of a risk, does not imply completely eliminating it.

#### Mitigation Tactics: PPT Approach (People, Processes, Technology)
1. **People:**
 - Involve technical staff and users in risk identification and management.
 - Example: Technical testers and end-users testing an application.

2. **Processes:**
 - Establish procedures for people to perform their tasks effectively.
 - Example: Testing process for app testers, including resource allocation, test execution, and findings reporting.

3. **Technology:**
 - Provide appropriate tools for risk mitigation.
 - Example: Specific testing tools to simulate malicious code executions.

#### Responses to Risk
- **Avoid:** Eliminate the activity that causes the risk.
- **Transfer:** Delegate risk management to a third party (e.g., insurers).
- **Accept:** Consciously decide not to take further action if the risk is within the acceptable risk appetite.
- **Not Ignore:** Recognize the risk; ignorance does not eliminate the risk.

#### Risk Appetite
- Definition of the acceptable level of risk for the organization in relation to a specific activity.

#### Importance of Risk Mitigation
- Effective mitigation requires a combination of people, processes, and technology tailored to the specific needs of the organization.
- Proper risk management involves not only identification and analysis but also the implementation of well-thought-out mitigation strategies.
- Choosing the appropriate risk response is crucial, always considering the constraints and risk appetite of the organization.

## Basic Statistics

### Distributions

#### Definition of Distribution
- Represents the frequency of all possible values that a variable can take.
- A variable: Any characteristic or measure that can vary between different subjects or data points.

#### Introductory Example
- Random sample from a population where each person's height in inches is recorded.
- The objective is to calculate the frequency of occurrence of each height or group of heights.

#### Visualization: Histogram
- Tool to visualize the distribution of a sample.
- Each box in the histogram represents a range of heights and their corresponding frequency in the sample.
- Example: Of 1,000 people, 36 measure between 51.66 and 55.06 inches.

#### Importance of Distributions
- Reveal patterns and insights about the data.
- Allow identification of common ranges and outliers.
- Facilitate understanding of how representative the data are of a broader population.

#### Normal Distribution
- Common bell shape in natural distributions of physical attributes (heights, weights).
- Most frequent values are in the middle, with less frequency at the extremes.
- Important for its prevalence and fundamental properties.

#### Other Types of Distribution
- In addition to the normal, there are other types of distribution, but the normal is fundamental and commonly observed in nature.

#### Applications and Relevance
- Understanding distributions is crucial for risk assessment and statistical analysis in data-based technologies.
- The normal distribution has specific properties that will be explored in greater detail in future videos.

### Central Tendency
#### Definition
 - Central tendency refers to the way of determining the central or "typical" value of a data set.

#### Main Measures of Central Tendency
 - **Mean (Average):** The sum of all values divided by the number of values.
 - Example: If the sum of all heights is X inches divided by 1,000 people, it results in an average of 68.75 inches.
 - **Median:** The middle value when all values are ordered from lowest to highest.
 - Example: If we order 1,000 heights, the median would be 68.69 inches.
 - **Mode:** The value that appears most frequently in the data set.
 - Example: The most common height (mode) among 1,000 people is 70.59 inches.

#### Importance of the Mean, Median, and Mode
 - In a normal distribution, the mean, median, and mode are equal and located in the center of the distribution.
 - They provide different perspectives on the "center" of the data, especially useful in non-normal distributions where they may differ.

#### Differences and Use
 - The mean can be affected by extreme values or outliers, which may not be representative of the data set.
 - The median offers a better indicator of the central value in skewed distributions, as it is not influenced by extreme values.
 - The mode is useful for identifying the most common value, but there may be more than one mode in a data set.

#### Application and Examples
 - **Normal Distribution:** Mean = Median = Mode.
 - **

Skewed Distribution:** Differences between the mean, median, and mode indicate the type and direction of the skew.

#### Selection of Appropriate Measure
 - The choice between mean, median, and mode depends on the data set and the purpose of the analysis.
 - There is not always a "best" measure; each provides valuable information about the data.

### Variance and Standard Deviation

#### Introduction to Variability
 - **Objective:** Evaluate how dispersed the values are in a distribution, i.e., the variability of the data.

#### Variance
 - **Definition:** Measures the dispersion of the data relative to the mean.
 - **Calculation:** Based on the squared differences between each data point and the mean of the set.
 - **Purpose:** Offers a quadratic measure of deviations from the mean, giving more weight to distant values.
 - **Limitation:** The resulting scale (being squared) can make direct interpretation of the data difficult.

#### Standard Deviation
 - **Definition:** The square root of the variance, returning the measure to the original scale of the data.
 - **Utility:** Provides a more intuitive interpretation of the data dispersion, facilitating comparison with the mean.
 - **Example:** In a sample of heights, a standard deviation of 9.71 indicates the dispersion of heights around the mean.

#### Interpretation of Standard Deviation
 - **Large Values:** Indicate that the data are very dispersed relative to the mean.
 - **Small Values:** Suggest that the data are more clustered near the mean.

#### Standard Deviation and Normal Distribution
 - **68-95-99.7 Rule:** 
 - Approximately 68% of the data fall within ±1 standard deviation of the mean.
 - Around 95% of the data are within ±2 standard deviations.
 - About 99.7% of the data are within ±3 standard deviations.
 - **Application:** Allows inferring the proportion of data that are within certain ranges around the mean.

#### Utility of Standard Deviation in Comparative Analysis
 - Allows comparison of the variability between different data sets that have the same mean but different dispersion.

### Skewness and Kurtosis:

#### Importance of Sample Size
 - **Larger Sample:** More likely to reflect the entirety of the population.
 - **Normal Distribution:** In large populations, symmetry in the distribution curve is expected.

#### Skewness
 - **Definition:** Deviation from symmetry in the distribution of data.
 - **Visualization:** Curves tilted to one side.
 - **Statistically:** Difference between mean, median, and mode.

#### Types of Skewness
 - **Positive Skewness (Left):**
 - **Indicator:** Positive value in the skewness formula.
 - **Characteristic:** Peak of the curve to the left, mean > median > mode.
 - **Implication:** More data at the lower end of the distribution.
 - **Negative Skewness (Right):**
 - **Indicator:** Negative value in the formula.
 - **Characteristic:** Peak of the curve to the right, mean < median < mode.
 - **Implication:** More data at the upper end of the distribution.

#### Kurtosis (Kurtas or Arc)
 - **Definition:** Measurement of the "heaviness" of the tails in a distribution.
 - **Utility:** Helps understand the presence of outliers.

#### Types of Kurtosis
 - **Mesokurtic:** Normal distribution.
 - **Leptokurtic:**
 - **Characteristic:** Clustering in the center with thin tails.
 - **Implication:** Strong presence of outliers.
 - **Platykurtic:**
 - **Characteristic:** More spread-out distribution with long, broad tails.
 - **Implication:** Absence of outliers.

#### Application of Skewness and Kurtosis
 - **Along with Standard Deviation:** Offer a more complete view of the distribution.
 - **Diagnosis:** Help identify errors or unwanted effects in the data.

### Correlation

#### Basic Definition
- **Correlation** measures the relationship or association between two variables.
- Indicates whether changes in one variable are associated with changes in another.

#### Visualization
- Represented in a **scatter plot**, with the X-axis for one variable and the Y-axis for the other.
- The patterns of points indicate the nature of the correlation.

#### Types of Correlation
1. **No Correlation:**
 - Points scattered randomly.
 - The trend line would be horizontal, indicating lack of relationship.

2. **Positive Correlation:**
 - The trend line rises from the lower left to the upper right.
 - Implies that both variables increase together.

3. **Negative Correlation:**
 - The trend line descends from the upper left to the lower right.
 - One variable increases while the other decreases.

#### Strength of Correlation**
- **Strong:** Points are close to each other, showing a clear trend.
- **Weak:** Points are scattered, with a less defined trend.

#### Importance of Correlation
- Helps identify potential relationships between variables.
- Does not imply causality. Correlation does

 not guarantee that one variable causes changes in another.

#### Practical Applications
- Data analysis to investigate possible connections between variables of interest.
- In the mentioned example, investigating whether there is a relationship between household income and house value.

#### Notes
- Correlation vs. Causality: A strong correlation does not necessarily mean that one variable causes the change in another.
- Relevance of other factors: Possible hidden variables that may influence the observed relationship.

### Probability

#### Basic Definition
- **Probability** measures the likelihood of an event occurring.
- Fundamental both in risk and in data-based technologies.

#### Initial Examples
1. **Coin Toss:** 50% chance of heads, 50% chance of tails.
2. **Six-faced Die:** 1/6 probability for each number (1-6).

#### Normal Distribution and Probability
- Normal distribution applied, for example, to the height of people.
- Probability of 68.2% of being within one standard deviation of the mean.

#### Probability in Data-Based Technologies
- Factors such as ethnicity, genetics, and diet complicate exact predictions.
- AI provides probability estimates based on available data, not absolute guarantees.

#### AI and Belief Models
- AI uses belief models based on experiences (data) to make predictions.
- The estimate comes with a certain level of uncertainty due to data limitation.

#### Importance of Probability
- Allows estimation of the occurrence of events in various contexts.
- In technology, helps to formulate predictions based on existing data.

#### Limitations and Considerations
- AI and other data-based technologies operate with uncertainty.
- Not all probabilities are as clear as tossing a coin; many depend on complex factors.

### Evaluation Metrics

#### Machine Learning

##### Definition and Purpose
- **Machine Learning (ML):** Discipline of AI that makes estimates based on data without direct programming.
- **Objective:** Improve the system's ability to solve problems through learning.

#### Mechanics of Machine Learning
- **Algorithms:** Instructions for solving problems.
- **Training Data:** Data introduced into the algorithm.
- **Model:** Implementation of an algorithm based on training data, used for predictions.

#### Categories of Machine Learning
1. **Supervised:** Training data include labels (correct answers).
2. **Unsupervised:** Does not use labels. 

#### Supervised Learning
- **Labeled Data:** Include the correct solution.
- **Example:** Predicting heart diseases with patient data that include whether they have the disease.
- **Main Results:** Classification and Regression.

#### Classification
- **Objective:** Categorize new data.
- **Example:** Identifying whether an image is a dog or not.

#### Regression

- **Common Use:** Clustering and dimensionality reduction.
- **Example of Clustering:** Customer segmentation based on common features.

#### Applications of Machine Learning
- **Diversity of Fields:** From medicine to marketing.
- **Importance of Probability:** Estimates based on data, not absolute guarantees.

### Classification Metrics

#### **Introduction**
- Focus on evaluating classification models in machine learning systems, using the example of a binary classification system for heart diseases.

#### **Types of Outcomes**
1. **True Positive (TP):** Correct prediction of the presence of disease.
2. **True Negative (TN):** Correct prediction of the absence of disease.
3. **False Positive (FP):** Incorrect prediction of the presence of disease.
4. **False Negative (FN):** Incorrect prediction of the absence of disease.

#### **Confusion Matrix**
- Visual tool for comparing actual values with predictions, showing TP, TN, FP, and FN.

#### **Main Metrics**
1. **Accuracy:** Proportion of correct predictions over all predictions. Useful but unreliable in unbalanced data sets.
2. **Precision (or Positive Predictive Value):** Frequency with which identified positives are true. Calculated as TP / (TP + FP).
3. **Recall (or Sensitivity):** Ability of the model to predict relevant cases. Calculated as TP / (TP + FN), focusing on minimizing FN.
4. **Specificity:** Ability of the model to correctly classify negative cases. Calculated as TN / (TN + FP).

#### **Notes**
- **Class Imbalance:** Accuracy can be misleading in data sets with unbalanced classes.
- **Trade-off between Precision and Recall:** Depending on the model's goal, prioritizing minimizing FN (recall) or FP (precision) is essential.
- **Importance of Domain:** The choice of metrics depends on the model's goal and the context of application.

### Cost Functions in Linear Regression

#### **Introduction**
- Conventional evaluation metrics such as accuracy and recall do not apply to linear regression. For these models, cost functions are used to measure the error between the predictions and the actual values

.

#### **Cost Function (Loss or Error)**
- Evaluates the error between the predicted and actual values.
- The objective of linear regression is to minimize this error, thereby improving the model's accuracy.

#### **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- **Definition:** Measures the average of the squared errors between the predictions and actual values.
- **Calculation:** Calculated by subtracting the predicted value from the actual, squaring the result, summing all these values for each record, and dividing by the total number of records.
- **Interpretation:** A low MSE indicates a more accurate model. There is no universally "good" MSE value; it is compared among models.

#### **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
- **Definition:** Square root of the MSE, offering a more interpretable scale and closer to that of the actual values.
- **Interpretation:** Like the MSE, a lower RMSE indicates greater accuracy of the model.

#### **Applied Example: Predicting House Values**
- **Process:** Compare the actual value of houses with the model's predictions, calculate the difference, square it, and then average it.
- **Result:** An calculated MSE or RMSE provides a measure of how much the model's predictions deviate from the actual values.

#### **Notes**
- **No ideal MSE or RMSE value exists**: The effectiveness of the model is determined by comparing its MSE or RMSE with other models addressing the same problem.
- **Human judgment essential**: Cost functions provide guidance on the model's effectiveness but do not definitively determine its success or failure.

### Reliability

#### **Introduction to Reliability**
- **Definition:** Ability of the model to consistently perform well on previously unseen data.
- **Importance:** Evaluating reliability is crucial to understanding how the model will perform in real-world applications.

#### **Reliability Challenges**
- **Overfitting:** Occurs when a model predicts too well on training data but fails to generalize to new data.
- **Indicators:** Metrics such as accuracy and MSE offer clues but do not ensure reliability outside the training set.

#### **Strategies for Improving Reliability**
1. **Larger Data:**
 - Increasing the volume of data can help the model generalize better.
 - Challenge: Often difficult to obtain large amounts of relevant data.

2. **Data Simplification:**
 - Remove outliers and noise.
 - Techniques such as dimensionality reduction can clean up the data for better generalization.

3. **Cross-validation:**
 - **Training Set:** Used to train the model (70-80% of the data).
 - **Test Set:** Reserved to test the model after training (10-30% of the data).
 - **Validation Set:** Optional, used to fine-tune the model before the final test (10% if used).
 - **Holdout Method:** The simplest form of cross-validation where data are divided into training and test sets.
 - **Advanced Cross-validation:** Involves rotations of the data split in multiple iterations to improve generalization.

#### **Notes**
- Evaluating and improving the reliability of machine learning models is fundamental to their success in practical applications.
- Strategies such as expanding the data set, simplifying it, and applying cross-validation are essential to combat overfitting and ensure that the model can generalize effectively to new data.
- A multidimensional approach that includes cross-validation and attention to data quality can significantly enhance the reliability of machine learning models.

### Goodhart's Law

#### **Introduction to Goodhart's Law**
- **Origin:** Named after economist Charles Goodhart, originally applied to monetary policy.
- **General Principle:** "When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure."

#### **Implications in AI**
- **Focus on a Single Metric:** Focusing exclusively on improving a specific metric can lead to misleading or undesirable results.
- **Example in AI:** Optimizing a model for disease detection to maximize recall may result in a high number of false positives, compromising other important metrics like precision and specificity.

#### **Risks of Overoptimization**
- **Compromise of Important Goals:** By focusing too much on one metric, other equally important ones may be ignored, negatively affecting the overall performance of the system.
- **Practical Consequences:** In the case of disease detection, high recall at the expense of precision could result in unnecessary and costly treatments, with potential adverse effects for patients.

#### **Risk Management and Goodhart's Law**
- **Balance of Metrics:** To avoid falling into the trap of Goodhart's Law, it is essential to evaluate and optimize AI models using multiple metrics.
- **Holistic Evaluation:** The most effective models are those considered successful through a balanced evaluation, not just in one dimension.

#### **Notes**
- Goodhart's Law underscores the importance of not allowing a single metric to dictate the development and evaluation of AI systems.
- Maintaining a balanced and multifaceted approach to model evaluation, considering several metrics for a comprehensive understanding of model performance, is crucial.
- By respecting the diversity of metrics and avoiding overoptimization in one dimension, AI specialists can create more reliable, effective, and ethically solid systems.
