# Applying Ethical Frameworks to Ethically Challenging Dilemmas

## General

### Turning Ethical Principles into Action

#### Scenarios to Cover
1. **Trolley Problem and Autonomous Cars:** Decisions about who to save in life-or-death situations.
2. **Emergencies and Disasters:** Prioritization and critical decision-making based on ethical frameworks.
3. **Patient Confidentiality in Health:** Navigating privacy laws like HIPAA and their relation to ethics.
4. **Social Issues and Harassment by AI:** Addressing the potential for social harm and harassment by AI systems.

#### Importance of Framework Selection
- There are over 85 ethical frameworks, each with a specific focus and audience (e.g., some are aimed at governments, others at individuals).


## Application of Frameworks to Ethical Dilemmas

### Applying Ethical Frameworks to the Trolley Problem

#### Introduction to the Trolley Problem
- **Situation:** A runaway trolley is headed towards a group of people tied to the tracks.
- **Options:**
  - Do nothing: the trolley kills the group.
  - Pull a lever: divert the trolley, killing one person on adjacent tracks.
- **Ethical Dilemma:** What is the most ethical action?

#### Utilitarian Approach
- **Preferred Action:** Pull the lever to save the greater number of people.
- **Considerations:**
  - Direct involvement in the death of one person.
  - Debate on moral responsibility for action vs. inaction.

#### Application of Ethical Frameworks
1. **Montreal Declaration for a Responsible AI (MDRAI):**
   - **Emphasis on:** Human autonomy, consideration of all sentient beings, responsibility in action and inaction.
   - **Advantages:** Holistic inclusion and emphasis on responsibility.
   - **Challenges:** Limited applicability to specific AI scenarios.
   
2. **Asilomar AI Principles:**
   - **Key Principles:** Safety, value alignment, transparency of failures.
   - **Advantages:** Promotes preparedness and awareness of AI failures and safe decisions.
   - **Challenges:** Generic application that could be tailored at the decider's convenience.

#### Notes
- **Importance of Guiding Principles:** They help define and guide ethical practices in complex situations.
- **Relevance of Ethical Frameworks:** Both frameworks provide useful perspectives but differ in application and emphasis on responsibility and transparency.

   - **Focus on:** Public safety and accountability.
   - **Advantages:**
     - Emphasis on enhancing public safety.
     - Termination clause for limited and specific use.
   - **Challenges:**
     - Lack of concreteness in principle application.
     - Wide margin for interpretation.
   
2. **Toronto Declaration (TD)**

     - Lack of solid guidance on privacy.
     - Potential insufficiency in addressing all ethical concerns.

#### Discussion
- **UGAI:** Provides clear ethical guidance for contact tracing with an emphasis on accountability
   and public safety, highlighting a termination clause to prevent misuse or undue prolonged use of the system.
- **TD:** Focuses on human rights and non-discrimination, offering an ethical framework to balance public health needs
   with the protection of privacy and individual rights.



### AI in Medicine - Bias vs. Humans

#### Context
- **Application Area:** Radiology and reading of medical imaging scans.
- **Dilemma:** AI systems show greater accuracy than human medical panels but lack explanatory capability.

#### Application of Ethical Frameworks

1. **Montreal Declaration for a Responsible AI (MDR)**
   - **Applicable Principles:** Prudence, Human Autonomy, Responsibility.
   - **Advantages:**
     - Anticipates negative consequences and ensures coherence with human decisions.
     - Promotes significant human control and boosts trust.
   - **Challenges:**
     - Margin of interpretation can lead to inconsistent applications.
     - Needs backing from regulatory instruments.

2. **Beijing AI Principles**
   - **Applicable Principles:** Informed Consent, Educational Formation.

     - Lack of specificity for content moderation.
     - Regional focus may limit global applicability.

#### Comparative Analysis

- **EAD vs. Ethical Guidelines:** EAD provides a broad framework for empowering autonomy, but lacks a specific focus on moderation. 
  Ethical Guidelines offer a risk-based framework with an emphasis on collective well-being, but its application may be regionally limited.

#### Notes

- **Combination of Frameworks:** Integrating multiple frameworks may offer a more effective balance between individual benefits and social responsibility.
- **Implementation Challenge:** The lack of specificity in content moderation and regional variability requires 
  an adaptive and possibly combined approach to effectively address the dilemma.

#### Notes
- The **emancipation of AI** from human oversight presents unique challenges in terms of control risks and ensuring human well-being.
- **BAIP** provides a framework for public oversight, while **OECD** advocates for maintaining human controls.
- Both approaches offer advantages in terms of risk awareness and promotion of openness, 
  but lack detailed guidelines for practical implementation.
- **Need for Balance:** Between operational autonomy of AI systems and effective human oversight 
  to ensure ethical and pro-social outcomes.
