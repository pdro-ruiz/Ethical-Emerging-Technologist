# Applying Ethical Frameworks to Ethically Challenging Dilemmas

## Overview

### Translating Ethical Principles into Action

#### Scenarios to Cover
1. **Trolley Problem and Autonomous Vehicles:** Decisions on who to save in life-or-death situations.
2. **Emergencies and Disasters:** Prioritization and critical decision-making based on ethical frameworks.
3. **Patient Confidentiality in Health:** Navigating privacy laws like HIPAA in relation to ethics.
4. **Social Issues and Harassment by AI:** Addressing the potential for social harm and harassment by AI systems.

#### Importance of Framework Selection
- There are more than 85 ethical frameworks, each with a specific focus and audience (e.g., some are aimed at governments, others at individuals).


## Application of the Framework to Ethical Dilemmas

### Applying Ethical Frameworks to the Trolley Problem

#### Introduction to the Trolley Problem
- **Situation:** A runaway trolley is heading towards a group of people tied to the tracks.
- **Options:**
  - Do nothing: the trolley kills the group.
  - Pull a lever: divert the trolley, killing one person on adjacent tracks.
- **Ethical Dilemma:** What is the most ethical action?

#### Utilitarian Approach
- **Preferred Action:** Pull the lever to save the greatest number of people.
- **Considerations:**
  - Direct involvement in the death of one person.
  - Debate over moral responsibility for action vs. inaction.

#### Application of Ethical Frameworks
1. **Montreal Declaration for a Responsible AI (MDRAI):**
   - **Emphasis on:** Human autonomy, consideration of all sentient beings, responsibility in action and inaction.
   - **Advantages:** Holistic inclusion and emphasis on responsibility.
   - **Challenges:** Limited applicability to specific AI scenarios.
   
2. **Asilomar AI Principles:**
   - **Key Principles:** Safety, value alignment, transparency of failures.
   - **Advantages:** Promotes preparedness and awareness of AI failures and safe decision-making.
   - **Challenges:** Generic application that could be tailored to the decider's convenience.

#### Conclusion
- **Importance of Guiding Principles:** They help define and guide ethical practices in complex situations.
- **Relevance of Ethical Frameworks:** Both frameworks provide useful perspectives but differ in application and emphasis on responsibility and transparency.



### Schematic Summary: Use of AI in Emergencies and Disasters

#### Context
- **Scenario:** Deployment of contact tracing technology during a pandemic to refine the public health response.
- **Dilemma:** Balance between public safety and individual privacy.

#### Application of Ethical Frameworks

1. **Universal Guidelines for AI (UGAI)**
   - **Focus on:** Public safety and accountability.
   - **Advantages:**
     - Emphasis on improving public safety.
     - Sunset clause for limited and specific use.
   - **Challenges:**
     - Lack of concrete application of principles.
     - Broad margin for interpretation.
   
2. **Toronto Declaration (TD)**
   - **Focus on:** Non-discrimination and international human rights.
   - **Advantages:**
     - Universal applicability and cross-border acceptance.
     - Based on human rights principles.
   - **Challenges:**
     - Lack of solid guidance on privacy.
     - Potential insufficiency in addressing all ethical concerns.

#### Discussion
- **UGAI**: Provides clear ethical guidance for contact tracing with an emphasis on responsibility
   and public safety, highlighting a sunset clause to prevent misuse or undue prolonged use of the system.
- **TD**: Focuses on human rights and non-discrimination, offering an ethical framework to balance public health needs
   with privacy protection and individual rights.

#### Conclusion
- Both frameworks offer valuable perspectives for addressing the use of AI in emergency situations, 
  highlighting the importance of maintaining a balance between public safety and the protection of privacy and human rights. 
  The choice of the right framework depends on the specific priorities and context of the situation.



### AI in Medicine - Bias vs. Humans

#### Context
- **Application Area**: Radiology and reading of medical imaging scans.
- **Dilemma**: AI systems show greater accuracy than human medical panels but lack explanatory capability.

#### Application of Ethical Frameworks

1. **Montreal Declaration for Responsible AI (MDR)**
   - **Applicable Principles**: Prudence, Human Autonomy, Responsibility.
   - **Advantages**:
     - Anticipates negative consequences and ensures consistency with human decisions.
     - Promotes meaningful human control and builds trust.
   - **Challenges**:
     - Margin of interpretation can lead to inconsistent applications.
     - Needs backing by regulatory instruments.

2. **Beijing AI Principles**
   - **Applicable Principles**: Informed Consent, Educational Formation.
   - **Advantages**:
     - Prom

otes understanding of risks by the patient.
     - Prepares physicians to handle system failures and communicate risks.
   - **Challenges**:
     - Lack of details on the practical implementation of principles.
     - Questions about the sufficiency of educational formation and informed consent.

#### Comparison and Conclusion

- **MDR vs. Beijing Principles**: Both frameworks offer useful perspectives for addressing the ethical dilemma, focusing attention on prudence, autonomy, responsibility, and informed consent as foundations for ethical use of AI in medicine.
- **Effectiveness**: MDR provides a holistic approach that encompasses trust and organizational values, while the Beijing Principles focus on consent and the preparation of the patient and medical professional.
- **Implementation**: Both frameworks face challenges in practical application, requiring clarity and regulatory support to ensure their effectiveness.



### AI and Self-destructive Behaviors

#### Context
- **Scenario**: Use of AI in social networks that promotes addictive behaviors through endless scrolling and hyper-personalized content.
- **Dilemma**: Balance between maximizing business profits and preserving user well-being.

#### Application of Ethical Frameworks

1. **Universal Guidelines for AI (UGAI)**
   - **Applicable Principles**: Data Quality, Prohibition of Secret Profiles, Public Safety.
   - **Advantages**:
     - Wide coverage of ethical concerns.
     - Guides towards user benefit.
   - **Challenges**:
     - Lack of concrete guidelines for implementation.

2. **Beijing AI Principles**
   - **Applicable Principles**: Informed Consent, Ethics by Design.
   - **Advantages**:
     - Promotes ethical considerations from the initial development.
     - Prevention of addictive interfaces and harmful reward systems.
   - **Challenges**:
     - Broad margin for interpretation.
     - Lack of specificity in implementation.

#### Comparison and Conclusion

- **UGAI** emphasizes proper data use and social impact, providing a framework to balance business gain
  with user well-being. However, it lacks detailed guidelines for practice.
- **Beijing Principles** focus on informed consent and inclusion of ethical considerations in design, 
  supporting the development of less harmful systems from the start. However, vagueness in practical application could limit effectiveness.
- **Recommended Approach**: Combining both frameworks can offer a balanced approach, ensuring both accountability
   in data use and incorporation of ethics in the design and development of AI, to mitigate self-destructive behaviors among users.



### Limits of Persuasive Technology in Smart Toys

#### Context

#### Comparison and Analysis

- **OECD vs. Ethical Guidelines**: OECD principles provide a general framework for ethical development,
  while Ethical Guidelines offer more detailed and pragmatic guidance, especially regarding autonomy and children's safety.
- **Product Development Impact**: Both frameworks seek to guide the creation of products that respect user autonomy
   and promote their well-being, though at different levels of detail and geographical applicability.

#### Conclusion

- **Ethical Balance**: It's crucial to balance technological innovation with the protection of vulnerable users, 
  ensuring that persuasive technology does not compromise the well-being or autonomy of children.
- **Framework Choice**: Will depend on the specific needs of the organization and the jurisdictional context in which it operates,
  though the trend is towards granular, use-case-based ethical application.
